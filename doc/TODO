NOT FINISHED YET:

- Permissions: Channel creation needs adding. Users being unable to message channels they aren't in needs moving into permissions, not core, for compatibility with other servers.

- (O)KICK: Needs to prevent rejoin for three seconds.

COMMANDS:

- INVITE
- AWAY
- LIST
- KILL
- VERSION

- OPFLAGS: Displays the flags of a channel operator. Can always be used on oneself, and with viewflags, others.


FEATURES:

- Hook run list, with hooks for actions caused by another action always happening after the first action's hooks- but, with ability to wait until all first-level hooks have been executed before continuing, so the caller can assume the next action it attempts is after the effects of its first have taken effect.

- Configuration system. Default settings for EVERYTHING.

- Logging scheme being implemented, and messages being added in appropriate places.

- Filter subsystem, calls into it from PRIVMSG and NOTICE, permitting colours to be stripped, auditorium mode, implementation of FILTER and SILENCE... unavoidably slow, though.

- On-connect messages.

- MOTD

- CAP
-- SASL (needs linking).

- Fakelag.

- Proper examination of buffer size, ability to grow/set buffer size up to some defined limit. Look at how other IRCDs do it.

- Cloaking.

- A linking module.

- Webclient module.
-- Whiteboard module.


MODULES:

- client/waitpong, make clients wait until they've responded to ping to connect.

- user/blockunreg, do not permit unchecked users to complete registration until they are logged in to some kind of account.

- user/silence, extend ban infrastructure to clients, permitting users to filter out other users.

- chan/oponcreate, making a user who creates a channel be opped in it.

- chan/hierarchy, implementing metadata which restricts deopping, and can be added or removed by anyone with the op privilege and a higher hierarchy metadata value. Plus client code to add the metadata as a user-specified list of prefix modes. Implements hierarchy markers which can mark any levels the channel admins wish to.

- oper/filter, filter on messages.
