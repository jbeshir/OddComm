COMMANDS:

FEATURES:

- On-connect messages.

- MOTD

- CAP
-- SASL (needs linking).

- Fakelag.

- Proper examination of buffer size, ability to grow/set buffer size up to some defined limit. Look at how other IRCDs do it.

-- Whiteboard module.


MODULES:

- client/waitpong, make clients wait until they've responded to ping to connect.

- user/blockunreg, do not permit unchecked users to complete registration until they are logged in to some kind of account.

- user/silence, extend ban infrastructure to clients, permitting users to filter out other users.

- chan/oponcreate, making a user who creates a channel be opped in it.

- chan/hierarchy, implementing metadata which restricts deopping, and can be added or removed by anyone with the op privilege and a higher hierarchy metadata value. Plus client code to add the metadata as a user-specified list of prefix modes. Implements hierarchy markers which can mark any levels the channel admins wish to.

- oper/filter, filter on messages.
